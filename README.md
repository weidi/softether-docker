# softether-docker

This container is designed to be as small as possible and host a SoftEther VPN Server
It´s based on Alpine so result is around 10MB!
It´s based on the great work of [SoftEherVPN](https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/SoftEtherVPN/)

You will be unable to bridge to a physical Ethernet adapter as there is no inside a Container but SecureNAT and other stuff that doesn´t need physical L2 will work.

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/toprock/softether:stable.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/toprock/softether:stable "Get your own version badge on microbadger.com") release from stable repository 

You can and should always specify your wanted version like `toprock/softether:5.01.9671` or `toprock/softether:4.32.9731`

Usage docker run
--------

This will keep your config and Logfiles in the docker volume `softetherdata`

`docker run -d --rm --name softether-vpn-server -v softetherdata:/mnt -p 443:443/tcp -p 992:992/tcp -p 1194:1194/udp -p 5555:5555/tcp -p 500:500/udp -p 4500:4500/udp -p 1701:1701/udp --cap-add NET_ADMIN toprock/softether`

### Use vpncmd

With newer releases I include vpncmd directly in the container so you can use it to configure the vpnserver. First start the vpnserver with the given command. Then you can run:

`docker exec -it softether-vpn-server vpncmd`

Usage docker-compose
--------
The same command can be achieved by docker-compose, the docker compose file is in the repository
```
version: '3'

services:
  softether:
    image: toprock/softether:5.01.9672
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: always
